**Thesis**  

I am currently a graduate student in School of Traffic and Transportation at Beijing Jiaotong University. My research focuses on transportation big data mining and travel behavior analysis. I specialize in using methods like the Hidden Markov Model and operations research optimization to tackle problems related to behavior analysis and traveler decision-making. I'm particularly interested in mining insights from large-scale, integrated datasets—such as ride-hailing and bike-sharing data, along with POI information—to uncover meaningful patterns and demands. Currently, I'm applying these techniques to practical areas like optimal planning for electric vehicle charging stations and understanding driver charging behavior. Outside of my research, I enjoy spending quality time with friends, whether it's exploring new places, trying out different foods, or cooking a nice meal together.
