Hello! I am an Assistant Professor at the [http://sss.bjtu.edu.cn School of Systems Science (SSS)] in [http://www.bjtu.edu.cn Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU)]. Prior to joining BJTU, I obtained my doctorate degree from the [https://twin-cities.umn.edu/ University of Minnesota, Twin Cities] in the U.S. and my bachelor's degree from [https://www.seu.edu.cn/ Southeast University] in China.

My main research interests lie in the broad sense of urban mobility. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
