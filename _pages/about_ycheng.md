**Thesis**  

I am a graduate student in Systems Science at Beijing Jiaotong University, building upon a solid undergraduate foundation in Mathematical Analysis, Operations Research, Information Theory, and Data Structures. My previous research includes a data-driven study on gastric cancer patient prognosis. Currently, my focus is on the joint optimization of modular vehicle formation and scheduling under uncertainty, where I develop optimization algorithms to mitigate the impact of system randomness. Beyond research, I enjoy badminton, photography, and traveling to explore the world and maintain a balanced life.
