**Thesis**  

I joined the research group in 2024. During my undergraduate studies, I investigated the impact of uncertainties such as policy changes and international market fluctuations on firms within the context of green trade barriers. My current research focuses on dispatch optimization for ride-hailing systems under uncertainty, primarily addressing the modeling of multiple uncertainties and complex scenarios. Outside of research, I am an avid sports enthusiast and has achieved multiple top rankings in university athletic competitions.
