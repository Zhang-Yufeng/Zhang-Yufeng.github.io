**Thesis**  

I joined the research group in 2025, and before this I conducted some optimization and coordination problems for supply chains. My current research interest is urban last-mile delivery optimization. I am passionate about identifying problems from everyday scenarios and seeking efficient solutions through building mathematical models. I also look forward to applying this way of thinking to team research and contributing to relevant projects.
